# Arizona Mortgage Statistics 1998-2021
“The National Mortgage Database (NMDB®) is a nationally representative five percent sample of residential mortgages in the United States” (National Mortgage Database, 1). The dataset includes residential mortgages in multiple categories from 1998 to 2021. It also includes an annual census of employment numbers and wages. The Federal Housing Finance Agency “conducts a monthly mortgage market survey to collect data on the characteristics of individual mortgages, both Enterprise and non-Enterprise, and to make the data available to the public while protecting the privacy of the borrowers” (1).
